# Interview-questions
A collection of some important questions for the interview - JavaScript, ReactJS, Ruby on Rails, etc.  

1. What is React?
React(aka React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source front-end JavaScript library that is used for building composable user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps based on components in a declarative approach.

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

2. What is the history behind React evolution?
The history of ReactJS started in 2010 with the creation of XHP. XHP is a PHP extension which improved the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions and the primary purpose was used to create custom and reusable HTML elements.

The main principle of this extension was to make front-end code easier to understand and to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks. The project was successful to prevent the malicious content submitted by the scrubbing user.

But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name FaxJ by Jordan inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React has been introduced as a new library into JavaScript world.

3. What are the major features of React?
The major features of React are:

Uses JSX syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code.
It uses Virtual DOM instead of Real DOM considering that Real DOM manipulations are expensive.
Supports server-side rendering which is useful for Search Engine Optimizations(SEO).
Follows Unidirectional or one-way data flow or data binding.
Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.

4. What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML and it is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript. Basically it just provides the syntactic sugar for the React.createElement(type, props, ...children) function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.

In the example below, the text inside <h1> tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.

export default function App() {
  return (
      <h1 className="greeting">{"Hello, this is a JSX Code!"}</h1>
  );
}

5. What is useState() in React?
The useState() is a built-in React Hook that allows you for having state variables in functional components. It should be used when the DOM has something that is dynamically manipulating/controlling.

In the below-given example code, The useState(0) will return a tuple where the count is the first parameter that represents the counterâ€™s current state and the second parameter setCounter method will allow us to update the state of the counter.

6. Why was virtual DOM introduced? 

DOM manipulation is an integral part of any web application, but DOM manipulation is quite slow when compared to other operations in JavaScript. The efficiency of the application gets affected when several DOM manipulations are being done. Most JavaScript frameworks update the entire DOM even when a small part of the DOM changes.

For example, consider a list that is being rendered inside the DOM. If one of the items in the list changes, the entire list gets rendered again instead of just rendering the item that was changed/updated. This is called inefficient updating.

To address the problem of inefficient updating, the react team introduced the concept of virtual DOM.

...
const [count, setCounter] = useState(0);
const [otherStuffs, setOtherStuffs] = useState(...);
...
const setCount = () => {
   setCounter(count + 1);
   setOtherStuffs(...);
   ...
};
We can make use of setCounter() method for updating the state of count anywhere. In this example, we are using setCounter() inside the setCount function where various other things can also be done. The idea with the usage of hooks is that we will be able to keep our code more functional and avoid class-based components if they are not required.
